<h1>Set on create function</h1>
<p>As class handler initializes empty object first of his class and than fills its properties with values there is difficult to write some catchy initialization code in class constructor.</p>
<p>Therefore after filling properties with values class handler calls $object-&gt;create() function if such exists. So if you want to do something after object is created than create function is for you.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">class user
{
    public $id;
    public $name;
    public function create ()
    {
        echo "an user was just created and filled by db.php";
    }
}</code></pre>
