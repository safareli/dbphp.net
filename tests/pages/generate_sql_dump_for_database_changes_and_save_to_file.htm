<p>Instead of running alter queries when using $database-&gt;update() you can save that queries to file for further testing and usage:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$database-&gt;update('\path\to\database_changes.sql');</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: In case of dump file in case of multi sql server/data source architecture you will not be able to distinguish which query belongs to which connection</em></p>
